# spis_verilog
This is a Verilog implementation of a very simple processor.<br>
If you want to write code for it, see ISA/index.html for documentation.

The reason I made this processor is that I wanted to learn how to use Verilog before starting on a larger project.

"SPIS" just stands for "Simple Processor Instruction Set"
